<p>The Virgo Web Server from EclipseRT is a completely module-based Java application server that is designed to run
enterprise Java applications and Spring-powered applications with a high degree of flexibility and reliability.
It offers a simple yet comprehensive platform to develop, deploy, and service enterprise Java applications.</p>

<p>The Virgo kernel supports the core concepts of Virgo and is not biased towards the web server, thus enabling other
types of server to be created. The kernel can also be used stand-alone as a rich OSGi application platform. A server
runtime can easily be constructed by deploying suitable bundles on top of the kernel.</p>
